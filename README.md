## My Process

I developed an NFT preview card component that features a modern design and interactive elements. Key aspects include responsive styling, lazy loading of images, and smooth transitions for user interactions.

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup:** Structured the page with semantic HTML elements for better accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS:** Utilized custom properties (variables) for consistent styling, and applied Flexbox and Grid for responsive layout.
- **JavaScript:** Managed lazy loading of images and interactive features with vanilla JavaScript.

### What I Learned

This project helped me improve my skills in:

- **HTML Semantics:** Properly structuring HTML to enhance accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Leveraging CSS variables for dynamic and consistent styling.
- **SCSS:** Using SCSS features to create modular and maintainable CSS.
- **JavaScript for Lazy Loading:** Implementing basic lazy loading and understanding event handling.
- **Responsive Design:** Applying Flexbox and CSS Grid to build a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

### Continued Development

Future updates will focus on:

- **Advanced JavaScript:** Implementing IntersectionObserver for more efficient lazy loading.
- **Enhanced CSS Animations:** Adding more complex animations and transitions to improve user interaction.
- **Accessibility Improvements:** Ensuring all interactive elements are fully accessible and improving keyboard navigation.
